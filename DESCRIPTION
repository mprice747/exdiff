Description: This packages offers functionalities to estimate the extrema of probability distributions. By applying a certain class of increasing, continuous functions called diffeomorphisms to a simple class of spline interpolations, any probability distribution within a specified compact interval and a given number of extrema, or nodes, can be estimated. In addition, with our formulation, the extrema can easily be inferred after the estimation procedure is complete. We offer both a maximum likelohood functionality that returns point estimates of the extrema and a Bayesian implementation via an elliptical slice sampler that outputs credible intervals for the extrema. Finally, we offer a graphical implementation that displays both the estimated probability distribution and the location of the extrema.
